This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The problem arises when trying to access the camera's internal state, such as the `isRecording` property, after the component has unmounted. This leads to unexpected behavior and potential errors, such as `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isRecording')`.  This is because the component's state might not be cleaned up properly before the component unmounts.
